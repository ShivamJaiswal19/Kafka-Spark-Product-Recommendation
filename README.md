# Kafka-Spark Product Recommendation System

This project demonstrates a product recommendation system using Apache Kafka and Apache Spark. It streams real-time product interactions, processes them in Spark, and generates recommendations.

## Technologies Used
- **Apache Kafka**: For real-time streaming and messaging.
- **Apache Spark**: For processing and generating recommendations.
- **Python**: For scripting and managing the application.
- **pyspark** and **kafka-python** libraries.

## Project Structure
- `kafka-product-recom.py`: Main script for Spark processing and recommendations.
- Kafka setup files for producer and consumer.

## Setup Instructions
### 1. Install Required Software
- [Install Apache Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/downloads)
- [Install Apache Spark](https://spark.apache.org/downloads.html)
- Set up a virtual environment and install dependencies:
  ```bash
  python3 -m venv myenv
  source myenv/bin/activate
  pip install -r requirements.txt
# Kafka-Spark Product Recommendation System

This project demonstrates a product recommendation system using Apache Kafka for streaming product interactions and Apache Spark for processing and generating recommendations. The system processes data as users interact with 
products, enabling it to provide recommendations dynamically.

## Background

In modern e-commerce, real-time recommendations play a critical role in enhancing user experience and boosting sales. Traditional batch processing techniques can't keep up with the speed required for real-time data processing. This 
project leverages the capabilities of **Apache Kafka** for high-throughput messaging and **Apache Spark** for fast data processing to simulate a recommendation engine that operates in real-time.

The recommendation engine listens to product interaction events (such as views, clicks, or purchases) and uses them to generate recommendations for similar or complementary products, all in real-time.

## Features

- **Real-Time Processing**: Uses Kafka to stream live user interactions and Spark to process and generate recommendations on the fly.
- **Scalability**: Kafka and Spark provide distributed processing, making the system scalable for large datasets.
- **Modular Design**: Can be easily extended to include more advanced recommendation algorithms.
- **Python-Based**: Uses Python, making it accessible for data science and machine learning tasks.

## Technologies Used

- **Apache Kafka**: Manages and streams real-time product interaction data.
- **Apache Spark**: Processes interaction data and generates recommendations.
- **Python**: Serves as the main programming language.
- **pyspark** and **kafka-python**: Libraries for integrating Spark and Kafka in Python.
